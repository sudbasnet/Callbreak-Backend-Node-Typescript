# Project
In this project, I'm trying to create an online multiplayer application for playing the game of "CALLBREAK". It is a card-game, played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The game should be played with 4 players, however, a modified version can be played with just 3 players.

As far as the project design is concerned, it will have the following parts or functionalities.

### Authentication 
*   Authentication is done with JSON Web Token (JWT)
*   User Actions:
    *   Registration (inc. user verification through email, reset password through email)
    *   Login
    *   Deactvation of account
    *   Deleting account permanently

### Gameplay
* The players should be able to invite other players to join their game.
* If 4 players are not available, player should be able to add bots.

### Communication among players (`socket.io`)
*   The in-game communication (moves made by the players) will also be done using `socket.io`
*   Chatting among the players.

### See game history or playbacks (Future)
* Authenticated players can view their past games.
* Players can also see their stats and games played by other players.

### The complete folder structure is as follows (only shows important files/folders):
(I'm Trying to base it on Clean Coding architecture by Bob Martin, I've designed the project structure in a way that makes sense to me ðŸ™‚, feedbacks are welcomed)
